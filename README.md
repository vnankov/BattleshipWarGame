# BattleshipWarGame
Destroy all battleships in order to win

The Problem

Implement a simple game of battleships http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_(game) 
You must create a simple application to allow a single human player to play a one-sided game of battleships against the computer.
The program should create a 10x10 grid, and place a number of ships on the grid at random with the following sizes:
1 x Battleship (5 squares)
2 x Destroyers (4 squares)
Ships can touch but they must not overlap.

You should implement a show command to aid debugging and backdoor cheat.


////Info
All ships are placed randomly.
If you shoot at battleships, you are not allowed to cheet.
